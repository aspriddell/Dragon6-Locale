# Dragon6 Locale (.NET)
## Overview
Dragon6 Locale is a collection of RESX files that are used in the PC app, the Mobile app has its own set, as they are more UI based and individualised. The Purpose of publishing these is so more developers creating stats apps can reach a larger target audience. It is easy to set up and will support a large collection of languages.

## What can this be used for?
Any Stats app that involves weapons, like CS:GO, PUBG and Rainbow Six (Which is what this is used by DragonFruit for)

## Setup & Usage

Once we have a few translations we will publish a NuGet Package and will provide instructions here once that is done. You'll find a lot of these strings are useful, but some are reserved for our apps (We'll let you decide which to use)

## Contribute

You can help us out on our Crowdin Server, and every so often, we will update this repo with the built translations. You can find our project at [DragonFruit Translate](https://translate.dragonfruit.network)

## Licence

All you need to do is add `DragonFruit.Locale Copyright (C) 2019 DragonFruit Network` to your about page and we will be happy :)
